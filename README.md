🚀 Power BI Project: Uber Ride Data Analysis Dashboard
This repository contains the source files (.pbix) and documentation for a comprehensive, interactive Uber Ride Data Analysis dashboard built using Power BI Desktop. The project's goal was to transform raw ride-sharing data into actionable business intelligence by visualizing key operational and financial metrics.

🎯 Key Dashboard Features
The dashboard provides a multi-page, detailed view of Uber's operations, focusing on vehicle performance, rider behavior, and geographical trends.

1. Executive Summary / Overview Page
This is the main landing page, offering a high-level snapshot of the business health (as seen in Screenshot 2025-11-01 105441.png):

Navigation: Intuitive navigation buttons (Home, Overview, Vehicle, Rider, Location) for seamless exploration.

2. Vehicle & Monthly Trend Analysis

This page allows users to slice the data by vehicle type (Auto, Bike, Go Mini, etc.) to understand specific operational segments.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Displays crucial metrics at a glance:

Completed Bookings

Lost Bookings

Revenue (e.g., $80.40K)

Total Distance and Average Distance

Monthly Trend: A dynamic area chart showing the volume/revenue trend over the year (Jan to Dec).

Revenue by Vehicle: Bar chart illustrating revenue contribution across different vehicle categories.

Ride Status Breakdown: Donut charts showing the ratio of Completed, Cancelled, and Incomplete rides for the selected vehicle type.

3. Geographical & Rider Insights
The dashboard effectively uses geographical data to pinpoint high-activity areas:

Top Pickup/Drop-off Locations: Detailed tables and visual summaries highlighting the busiest areas (e.g., Govindpuri, Samaypur Badli, Adarsh Nagar) in terms of Booking Count.
